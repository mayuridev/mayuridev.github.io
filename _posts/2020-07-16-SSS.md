title: 'S.S.S.'

---

This is a writeup for HexionCTF 2020, where [RGBsec](https://rgbsec.xyz) placed third.

### Challenge Description:

```
Math is so beautiful and can always be used for cryptographic
encryption!
nc challenges1.hexionteam.com 5001
```



### Solving : 

We are given an sss.py. See [here](https://pastebin.com/uYwhAUcX) for source.

We found that SSS stands for Shamir’s Secret Sharing by copy-pasting the loop from `eval_at`, which brought me to this Wikipedia [page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir's_Secret_Sharing). Shamir Secret Sharing is based on polynomials and lagrange interpolation. 

<!--more-->

Most of this code (nearly everything except main) is taken from Wikipedia’s example implementation of Shamir’s Secret Sharing. The concept is relatively simple. The sss.py that we are given is giving out "shares", with the flag as the secret. We can just request enough shares until we meet the minimum threshold to be able to recover the secret. From there, we can use langrage interpolation to calculate y for x=0 and retrieve our flag.
