title: 'Access=0000'

---


This is a writeup for a crypto challenge in [RACTF](https://ractf.co.uk/) 2020, where [we](https://rgbsec.org) placed 6th.


### Challenge Description:

```
Challenge instance ready at 95.216.233.106:57735

We found a strange service, it looks like you can generate an access token for the network service, but you shouldn't be able to read the flag... We think.
```
### Solving : 

We are given [access.py](https://pastebin.com/3e9ryfvf). Lets take a look the server file to see what the program does.

From the top, we see that `get_flag`: 
<!--more-->
```python
def get_flag(token, iv):
    token = bytes.fromhex(token)
    iv = bytes.fromhex(iv)
    try:
        cipher = AES.new(KEY, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
        decrypted = cipher.decrypt(token)
        unpadded = unpad(decrypted, 16)
    except ValueError as e:
        return {"error": str(e)}
    if b"access=0000" in unpadded:
        return {"flag": FLAG}
    else:
        return {"error": "not authorized to read flag"}
```

   1) converts `token` and `iv` to their representation as "bytes"

   2) tries to decrypt `token` with the given `key` and `iv`

   3) if the string `access=0000` is in the message, then it will return the flag

   4) if the string `access=0000` is not in the message, else print `not authorized to read flag`



Below that is `generate_token`:

```python
def generate_token():
    expires_at = (datetime.today() + timedelta(days=1)).strftime("%s")
    token = f"access=9999;expiry={expires_at}".encode()
    iv = get_random_bytes(16)
    padded = pad(token, 16)
    cipher = AES.new(KEY, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
    encrypted = cipher.encrypt(padded)
    ciphertext = iv.hex() + encrypted.hex()
    return {"token": ciphertext}
```

1) creates an expiration date

2) generates a token string with `access=9999` (defined with guest + token expire time)

3) generates a random `iv`

4) pads `token` to the AES block size

5) creates a new AES cipher instance

6) encrypts the padded `token` 

7) generates the cipher text as a result of `iv.hex()` and `encrypted.hex()`

8) returns the ciphertext

As we can see, the goal of this challenge  is to retrieve the flag by generating a guest token = `access=9999` and forge an admin token = `access=0000`. As we can see from `generate_token()`, guest tokens are generatated with an AES-CBC mode encryption of `access=9999;expiry={expires_at}`. In the AES-CBC mode, the stream is split into 16-byte blocks, with each block encrypted with AES. Then the result is sent to output and XORed with the next block before it gets encrypted. 

![Here is a depiction of CBC mode encryption.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/CBC_encryption.svg/1920px-CBC_encryption.svg.png)

 The ciphertext (the result of the encryption) is = `c[i] = AES_Enc(c[i-1] XOR m[i])` with `c[0]` being `iv`. If we want to decrypt the ciphertext, we can use the following formula = `m[i] = AES_Dec(c[i]) XOR c[i-1]` 

### Solve Script : 

```python
token = '3913er43j134h6d4fk81df97h4812df315dfd978g62fuehf38173g7eba445g9833kj1371637h26hfa3khuy3j5vx948d0'
token = bytes.fromhex(token)

iv = token[:16]
ct = token[16:]

for i in range(7,11):
    iv = iv[:i] + bytes([(iv[i] ^ ord('0') ^ ord('9'))]) + iv[i+1:]

print(iv.hex())
print(ct.hex())
```

This script replaces `iv` with `iv XOR D`, so the first block of the plaintext will be decoded as `m[0] XOR D`. We can XOR our `iv` to change the guest token (`access=9999`) to the admin token (`access=0000`).
